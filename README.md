# Open Podcast Format Specification

# Motivation

Currently (2020 and continue) Podcasting community are using RSS specification from Apple iTunes, and it is de facto standard, but with a lof of disadvantages:

- RSS is not usefull format, it's not easy to parse and it's hard for implementation for backend side, because a lot of languages didnt provide built-in (standart) library for parsing RSS.

- It's common and didn't provide extending like guests page, and etc

- Podcasting is not only audio files, it should have posts / votes and another things in the core.

- No support for declaring information for Podcast creator / Network and another staff
